Django is a free and open source web application framework written in Python. 
A framework is nothing more than a collection of modules that make development easier. T
hey are grouped together, and allow you to create applications or websites from an existing source, instead of from scratch.

This is how websites - even simple ones designed by a single person - can still include advanced functionality 
like authentication support, management and admin panels, contact forms, comment boxes, file upload support, and more.
 In other words, if you were creating a website from scratch you would need to develop these components yourself. 
 By using a framework instead, these components are already built, you just need to configure them properly to match your site.
